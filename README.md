# Zimblo's Note App
hyper minimal note script. 

Inspired by the TempleOS note function

The idea:
* functions instantaneously
* does not require you to save. 
* deletes on system reboot unless saved
* used for storing low importance data

```
$ note -h

Text saved in /tmp/note
Ctrl-D to save/exit

# Note
The note file is a bash script. I reccomending putting it in your path. ex `/usr/bin`

It does not require root access. 

It is especially useful on window managers. I bind to `$mod+n`
